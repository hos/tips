#+title: Maxima Tips

* Startup Defaults

I use wxMaxima (maxima) as my primary CAS software Here are some defaults that exist in
every file I author.

These two lines need to be there for the debugging cycle. When I make a change
to the code, I prefer to evaluate every line from scratch to avoid bugs. These
lines need to be added to the top to ensure a fresh start each time.

#+begin_src maxima
kill(all);
reset();
#+end_src

Some packages are essential in some contexts, and better be noted:
#+begin_src maxima
load("eigen");
load("vect");
#+end_src

Enables auto-simplification of some expressions.
#+begin_src maxima
simp: true;
#+end_src
