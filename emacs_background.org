#+title:  "Starting Emacs as a background process by default"

Emacs does not start in the background by default, so if you want to continue
using your shell, you must append `&` to the end of your command like

#+begin_src sh
$ emacs &
#+end_src

It is those small things that matter in life, and you might find it surprising
how much stress is relieved when you don't have to type `&` every time you start
a crucial program. So I defined the following function in my zsh
configuration.

#+begin_src sh
function em() {
  (emacs "$@"&)
}
#+end_src

It also works for bash. So when you want to edit a file, you can just type

#+begin_src sh
$ em yourfile.txt
#+end_src

Please note that it discards the output and error messages.

So there it is. I was inspired by gvim in this.
