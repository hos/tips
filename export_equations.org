#+TITLE: Exporting equations from LaTeX to transparent png files

* Preview package
Refer to this so post: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/14974/exporting-all-equations-from-a-document-as-individual-svg-files

First, add the following to your LaTeX file. Include the other environments you
want to include.
#+begin_src LaTeX
\usepackage[active,tightpage]{preview}
\PreviewEnvironment{equation}
\PreviewEnvironment{equation*}
\PreviewEnvironment{align}
\PreviewEnvironment{align*}
#+end_src

Burst the pdf file
#+begin_src sh
pdftk yourfile.pdf burst
#+end_src

Then move the resulting files to a separate directory, and run the following to obtain:
#+begin_src sh
for i in *.pdf do; convert -density 300 $i $i.png;
#+end_src

* Extracting without numbers
For extracting without equation numbers, check out @Damiens's answer from the SO
post:

To extend the answer from @Kilgore:

To get rid of the equation numbers (AND you have an excellent backup of the original file(s)!), yon can do the following:

#+begin_src bash
#!/bin/bash

files=`find . | grep -e '\.tex$'`

for file in $files ; do

    echo "Stripping: $file"
    sed -i 's/begin{equation}/begin{equation*}/g'   $file
    sed -i 's/end{equation}/end{equation*}/g'   $file

done
#+end_src

The individual equations can be extracted using:

#+begin_src LaTeX
\usepackage[active,tightpage]{preview}
\PreviewEnvironment{equation*}
\PreviewEnvironment{align*}
#+end_src

(Note the addition of the *)

To remove the excessive whitespace, use the following utility:

#+begin_src sh
pdfcrop output.pdf
#+end_src

And, finally, you can split this into individual svg files

#+begin_src sh
pdf2svg filename.pdf output-page%03d.svg all
#+end_src
